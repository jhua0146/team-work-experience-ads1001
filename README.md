1. The main aim of the project was to build a model that predicted whether a patient would survive their ICU stay.
2. Using information on patient demographics and indicators of health, we determined which variables have a greater impact on the outcome. As the result, we figure out that the Maximum Blood Urea Nitrogen, Minimum Bicarbonate, minimum potassium and maximum potassium has higher effect of the patient that survive in the ICU.
